## Component Selection HMI System

### Role within Group
My role on the team is the HMI system. It is required that I have a screen and a control system on it for the end user to control. This will be done using an ESP32 to communicate with the board and my teammates' boards.The display will show data taken from teammates' boards and will present it in a “good on the eyes” fashion while still keeping it strictly to what is neccesary.
